How to run in IntelliJ
=======================

1. First, clone this repo to local. Example c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project
1. rm -rf c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project\.idea (i should not have checked this in, delete it for now)
1. In IntelliJ create a new empty project with path c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project
1. Next setup Project SDK to JDK 11. 
   1. Intellij -> File -> Project Structure -> Project -> Project SDK = JDK 11
1. Then add spring-boot-admin app (in c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project) as a module. 
   1. Make sure you import the module as gradele. It is best to select directory spring-boot-admin. Here are the specific steps.
   1. Intellij -> File -> Project Structure -> Modules
      1. Add module (click +)
      1. Import Module (as gradle)
      1. navigate to c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project\spring-boot-admin
      1. click OK
      1. IMPORTANT: to make the project work within 53 VPN you need to go through JFrog 
         1. build.gradle (need buildscript to use jfrog.gradle) (see other existing projects as reference)
         1. copy down jfrog.gradle
         1. settings.gradle. copy everything but rootaProject.name
1. Then add my-app (in c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project) as a module.
   1. Intellij -> File -> Project Structure -> Modules
      1. Add module (click +)
      1. Import Module (as gradle)
      1. navigate to c:\gitrepos\spring-boot-admin-project\my-app
      1. click OK

if all goes well, both apps should build properly

SBA=spring-boot-admin

to start SBA right click on src/main/java/com/example/demo/springbootadmin/SpringBootAdminApplication.java and hit Run

then in the browser http://localhost:8080

SBA starts and begins to listen to apps
Since no apps are running, SBA now should show application count as 0

next start my-app. this app represents the application managed by SBA.
to do this, right click src/main/java/com/example/demo/myapp/MyAppApplication.java and hit Run

SBA now should show application count as 1


Differences between these apps and our apps
============================================
our apps use gradle to build but these use maven. no big deal just saying..


How was this created
====================
Created new project following SBA maintainerâ€™s instructions here

## spring-boot-admin (SBA)
use sprint initializer with spring boot admin server

## my-app
use sprint initializer with web and spring boot admin client
